## Issues

[Issues](https://github.com/nicolaskruchten/pivottable/issues/new) are the preferred way to communicate with the author and users of PivotTable.js, rather than private email.

* If you have multiple questions, please create multiple issues.
* Please do not add a comment to an existing issue to ask an unrelated question, especially if it's already closed. Instead, create a new issue instead and reference the older one.
* When creating issue to report a problem, please try to provide a replicable test case (code, a set of steps and/or a URL demonstrating the problem) so that others can help you.
